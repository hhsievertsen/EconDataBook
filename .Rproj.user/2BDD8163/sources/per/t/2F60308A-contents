# Welcome {-}




This book is written for Economics students at the University of Bristol to bridge the gap between technical documents about economic concepts and textbook treatments of economic concepts. Each chapter concludes with some suggestions for further readings.

Please let me know if you find mistakes, find a section unclear, or if you have suggestions for improvements. You can contact me on h.h.sievertsen@bristol.ac.uk.^[I owe a big thanks to all students who have contributed to this book, especially to Viktoria Leins who updated several figures and identified numerous mistakes. ]

Thanks,
Hans
